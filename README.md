Howdy!

My name is Alfonzo Galvan and I'm currently an Applied Mathematics major at Texas A&M University. My focus is in Computational Sciences and this has greatly widened my view of mathematics and it's many applications in the technology we use everyday.I'm making this Github to showcase and keep track of the projects that I've gotten to do inside and outside of school.
